   Building PentiKeyboard
   ----------------------

First make sure to have Java-8 installed

   $ update-alternatives --config java  # 2

Then create a directory "android_sdk" in some convenient place

   $ mkdir android_sdk
   $ cd android_sdk

Download Android Command Line Tools for Linux. For this, go to

   https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line

and download the sdk-tools ZIP file for Linux. Unpack it

   $ unzip sdk-tools-linux-<xxx>.zip

and use the SDK Manager to install the following packages:

   $ tools/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools"
   $ tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-28"
   $ tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;28.0.3"
   $ tools/bin/sdkmanager "tools"

You will need to create your own keystore for signing the APK later

   $ keytool -genkeypair -validity 365 -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048

Fetch PentiKeyboard.tgz from software-lab.de and extract it

   $ tar xfz PentiKeyboard.tgz

Then change to this directory, and build the PentiKeyboard APK:

   $ cd PentiKeyboard/
   $ mkdir obj
   $ ./mk.pentiKeyboard

This results in an installable APK file "pentiKeyboard.apk".
